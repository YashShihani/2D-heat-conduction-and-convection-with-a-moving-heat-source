# 2D-heat-conduction-and-convection-with-a-moving-heat-source
In this case study we have performed a experiment on square plate and with a moving heat source we can know the heat transfer at every point. Like we can take a example of welding, welding torch is a heat source and we move it over the plate and we can know the heat transfer rate at every point
